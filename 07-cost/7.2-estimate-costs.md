## Definitions

- Define the cost unit
- Define the method to calculate the estimated cost

- cO: Optimistic cost
- cM: Medium cost
- cP: Pessimistic cost
- cE: Estimated cost

- Cost Unit: Dollar (US$)

```math
cE = (cO + 4 * cM + cE) / 6
```

## Estimates

| Cost     | cO  | cM  | cP  | cE   |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| Resource | 1   | 2   | 4   | 2.17 |
