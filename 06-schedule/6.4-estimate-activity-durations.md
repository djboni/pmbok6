## Definitions

- Define the time period
- Define the method to calculate the estimated time

- tO: Optimistic time
- tM: Medium time
- tP: Pessimistic time
- tE: Estimated time

- Time Period: 1 hour/day/week

```math
tE = (tO + tM + tE) / 3
```

## Duration Estimates

| Activity | tO  | tM  | tP  | tE  |
| -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Activity | 1   | 2   | 4   | 2.3 |
