This project helps you to start a project management wiki, based on
PMBOK Guide (6th ed).

## Using

Just copy the file structure to the wiki (or to a normal project) and
start using it.

You start in the home page
[home.md](https://github.com/djboni/pmbok6/blob/master/home.md),
use the links to navigate through the processes and edit them.

A nice thing about wikis on GitHub and GitLab is that they are
source-controlled using Git, so you can look at any past state of your
project management.
