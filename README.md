This project helps you to start a project management wiki, based on
PMBOK Guide (6th ed).

## Using

Just copy the file structure to a normal project (or to a wiki) and
start using it.

- Start in the home page:
  [home.md](https://github.com/djboni/pmbok6/blob/master/home.md);
- Use the links to navigate through the documents and processes; and
- Edit the documents.

A nice thing about wikis on GitHub and GitLab is that they are
source-controlled using Git, so you can look at any past state of your
project management.
